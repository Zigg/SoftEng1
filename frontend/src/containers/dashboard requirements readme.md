TODO: Maybe add timeframes (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) Reporting etc. Implement Charts and Graphs for better visualization of data.
TODO: This will be holding mock data for now as the backend is not yet implemented which orders, products. User can be fetched though

TODO: Tree structure of the possible design for the dashboard items and menu items and subitems

TODO: Note these are set as functionalities or sub menus, user can have all these functionalities under one page etc as well as orders these aren't necessarily different submenus for the dashboard
